System overview:
LEWIS is a Roomba iCreate_2 controlled over a proprietary serial connection by an Arduino Esplora. By utilizing the system's built in
commands, we are able to query the robot for data (e.g. Right and Left encoder values) which, in turn, will be supplied in the
appropriate form to a laptop (HS-ACOOL-T) running ROS v_Jade_Turtle on Ubuntu v_15.04. Packages running in ROS are roscore,
robot_odometry, and MM_gmapping.
robot_odometry is included in this solution as a .cpp. It was originally developed by Jiatong Bao to run on the Michigan State
University Robotics and Automation Lab platform "Mobile Manipulator". It was then modified by Adam Cool to work in this application.
MM_gmapping is a modified version of the ROS package gmapping, again to use on the Mobile Manipulator. No modifications are necessary
since MM_gmapping was modified specifically to work in conjunction with robot_odometry.
MM_gmapping produces a point cloud consisting of all points representing the closest point to the robot in a vertical plane.



To do:
Send odometry data from LEWIS to ROS (specifically to Robot_Odometry.cpp)
	-receive encoder values from LEWIS and read into Esplora
	-send in useable form over serial connection on USB to Robot_Odometry.cpp on HS-ACOOL-T
		-baud rate? (as fast as possible)
		-
Prove map building capbility based on sent odometry data
